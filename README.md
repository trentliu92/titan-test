# KM / Titan HST Web Challenge
This is a 1-hour coding challenge designed to test the basic principles of ReactJS and CSS. You do not have to follow the project structure given to you. Feel free to organize your project however you'd like.

## Criteria
Try and tackle as many bullet points as you can before your time is up.

1. Your card must resemble the design presented in Adobe XD. It does not have to be pixel perfect
2. Your feed must pull and append 5 new results every 5 seconds
3. Your feed must be able to filter by three choices from a select menu:
	a.  No Filter
	b.  Male
	c.  Female
4. [optional] The card, on click, will permanently delete from the feed

## Other Notes
All the images you need are in the /src/images folder

The Styled Components library has been installed. You do not have to use this if you're more comfortable with something else.
